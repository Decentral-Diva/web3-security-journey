# Day 2 - Introduction to Rust Memory & Safety Model

## Overview

Today’s lesson introduced the core idea behind Rust’s design philosophy:

Rust is not just a programming language, but a system designed to prevent memory-related bugs at compile time.

The focus was on understanding *why* Rust is strict, not just how to use it.

---

## Key Ideas I Learned

### 1. Rust’s Design Goal
Rust is designed to eliminate:
- Memory leaks
- Data races
- Use-after-free errors
- Buffer overflows

It achieves this through compile-time rules rather than runtime checks.

---

### 2. Memory as a System

A running program interacts with memory through layers:

- Operating system abstraction
- Virtual memory system
- Process memory space
- Stack, heap, and static regions

---

### 3. Why Ownership Matters

Rust enforces memory safety using:
- Ownership rules
- Borrowing rules
- Lifetimes

These rules control how data is accessed and shared in memory.

---

### 4. Big Picture Understanding

Instead of thinking:
> “How do I fix compiler errors?”

We are learning to think:
> “How does Rust design prevent unsafe memory behavior in the first place?”

---

## My Understanding (in my own words)

Rust forces developers to think carefully about how memory is used in order to prevent bugs that normally happen at runtime in other languages.

The compiler acts like a strict system that ensures memory safety before the program even runs.

---

## What I Want to Understand Next

- How ownership is represented internally in memory
- How borrowing actually works at runtime
- How Rust translates code into lower-level representations
- How unsafe Rust breaks these guarantees

---

## Reflection

This lesson is building the foundation for understanding why Rust is used in systems like blockchain and Web3, where memory safety and correctness are critical.
